OpenNebula is a lightweight datacenter management solution to operate the private, public, and hybrid clouds running on the KVM, LXD, and VMware technologies. It can serve small compact clouds with just a few nodes, and scale to thousands of computing cores over multiple federated zones. It's easy to install, maintain and upgrade, and comes with its own Marketplace, offering a selection of base appliances with popular Linux distributions with which you can quickly start. Extensive documentation covers wide range of uses, from the individual end-user to the cloud administrator preparing the deployment.

vOneCloud is just a nice and easy way to try the latest OpenNebula version on an existing vCenter instance. In a nutshell, it is an OVA file with a configured CentOS, and a vanilla OpenNebula up and running, configured with Apache ready to import resources from vCenter environments.
