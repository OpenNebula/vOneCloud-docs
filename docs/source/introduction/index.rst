vOneCloud is an OpenNebula distribution optimized to interact with existing VMware vCenter deployments. 

vOneCloud ships as a virtual appliance in OVA format, ready to be deployed on an existing VMware vCenter, achieving an enterprise-ready OpenNebula cloud just in a few minutes. This leverages already familiar VMware tools, such as vSphere and vCenter Operations Manager, adding cloud features such as provisioning, elasticity and multi-tenancy.
