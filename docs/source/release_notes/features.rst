vOneCloud leverages the functionality of OpenNebula. The following features come preconfigured and can be used out-of-the-box with vOneCloud:

- `Advanced Multi-tenancy with Group Management <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#advanced-multi-tenancy-with-group-management>`__. Create and group users, and their access to infrastructure resources.

- `On-demand Provision of Virtual Data Centers <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#on-demand-provision-of-virtual-data-centers>`__. Partition your cloud in fully-isolated virtual infrastructure environment.

- `Standard Cloud Interfaces and Simple Provisioning Portal for Cloud Consumers <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#standard-cloud-interfaces-and-simple-provisioning-portal-for-cloud-consumers>`__. Ease IaaS provisioning for end users with the intuitive Cloud View web interface.

- `Virtual <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#advanced-control-and-monitoring-of-virtual-infrastructure>`__ & `Physical <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#advanced-control-and-monitoring-of-physical-infrastructure>`__ Infrastructure Control. Manage all aspects of your physical (hypervisors, storage backends, etc) & virtualized (VM lifecycle, VM images, virtual networks, etc) from a centralized web interface (Sunstone).

- `Broad Commodity and Enterprise Platform Support <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#broad-commodity-and-enterprise-platform-support>`__. Underlying OpenNebula software features an amazingly flexible and plugin oriented architecture that eases the integration with existing datacenter components. Do no reinvent your datacenter, evolve it!.

- `Management of Multi-tier Applications <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#management-of-multi-tier-applications>`__. Execution of multi-tiered applications with automatic scaling, write elasticity rules using selected key performance indicators from the hypervisor or `from the application <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#gain-insight-into-cloud-applications>`__.

- `Reliability, Efficiency and Massive Scalability <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#reliability-efficiency-and-massive-scalability>`__. Leverage years of testing and production use, and be sure that your Cloud Mangement Platform will be up to the task.

vOneCloud can levarage all the functionality that OpenNebula delivers, but some of it needs additional configuration steps:

- `Support for Auth Backends <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#powerful-user-security-management>`__. Secure your Cloud infrastructure with different authorization and authentication mechanisms and backends.

- `Hybrid Cloud Computing and Cloud Bursting <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#hybrid-cloud-computing-and-cloud-bursting>`__. Outsource virtual machines to public cloud providers to attend peak demands when the local infrastructure is saturated.

- `Centralized Management of Multiple Zones <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#centralized-management-of-multiple-zones>`__. Federate different datancenters by joining several vOneCloud instances.

- `Community Virtual Appliance Marketplace <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#community-virtual-appliance-marketplace>`__. Benefit from community contributions with an online catalog of ready-to-run virtual appliances.

Although the configuration is tailored for vCenter infrastructures, all the power of OpenNebula is contained in vOneCloud and it can be unleashed!
