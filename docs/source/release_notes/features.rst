vOneCloud can levarage all the functionality that OpenNebula delivers, but some of it needs **additional configuration** steps:

* `Centralized Management of Multiple Zones <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#centralized-management-of-multiple-zones>`__. Federate different datancenters by joining several vOneCloud instances.

* `Community Virtual Appliance Marketplace <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#community-virtual-appliance-marketplace>`__. Create your own marketplace or benefit from community contributions with an online catalog of ready-to-run virtual appliances.

* `Broad Commodity and Enterprise Platform Support <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#broad-commodity-and-enterprise-platform-support>`__. Underlying OpenNebula software features an amazingly flexible and plugin oriented architecture that eases the integration with existing datacenter components. Do no reinvent your datacenter, evolve it!.

* `Virtual <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#advanced-control-and-monitoring-of-virtual-infrastructure>`__ & `Physical <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/features.html#advanced-control-and-monitoring-of-physical-infrastructure>`__ Infrastructure Control. Manage all aspects of your physical (hypervisors, storage backends, etc) & virtualized (VM lifecycle, VM images, virtual networks, etc) from a centralized web interface (Sunstone).

Although the configuration is tailored for vCenter infrastructures, all the power of OpenNebula is contained in vOneCloud and it can be unleashed!
