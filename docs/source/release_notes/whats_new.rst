What's New vOneCloud 4.10
=========================

This is the first stable release of the vOneCloud appliance. The appliance is powered by OpenNebula Fox Fur, and, as such, includes all the functionality present in `OpenNebula Fox Fur 4.10.1 <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/index.html>`__.

Compared to the beta version of vOneCloud 4.10, this stable release comes with a number of bug fixes that can be consulted in the `OpenNebula development portal <http://dev.opennebula.org/projects/opennebula/issues?query_id=60>`__. 

Additionally, three new features were introduced in this stable release:

- :ref:`Ability to search for VM templates recursively <acquire_resources>`. Do not miss a VM Template!
- :ref:`VCenter password encrypted in vOneCloud host templates <encrypt_key>`. Protect your infrastructure.
- :ref: `Contextualization for vCenter VMs <contextualization>`. Pass information (licenses, ssh keys, networking information) onto your vCenter VMs through vOneCloud.
