What's New vOneCloud 1.2
========================

This is the release candidate of the vOneCloud 1.2 appliance. The appliance is powered by OpenNebula Fox Fur, and, as such, includes all the functionality present in `OpenNebula Fox Fur 4.10.1 <http://docs.opennebula.org/4.10/release_notes/release_notes/index.html>`__.

Compared to the beta version of vOneCloud, this stable release comes with a number of bug fixes that can be consulted in the `OpenNebula development portal <http://dev.opennebula.org/projects/opennebula/issues?query_id=60>`__.

Additionally, three new features were introduced in this stable release:

- :ref:`Ability to search for VM templates recursively <acquire_resources>`. Do not miss a VM Template!
- :ref:`VCenter password encrypted in vOneCloud host templates <encrypt_key>`. Protect your infrastructure.
- :ref:`Contextualization for vCenter VMs <build_template_context>`. Pass information (licenses, ssh keys, networking information) onto your vCenter VMs through vOneCloud.
