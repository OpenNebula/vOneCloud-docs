What's New vOneCloud 2.2
========================

vOneCloud 2.2 is powered by OpenNebula 5.2 'Excession', and, as such, includes functionality present in :onedoc:`OpenNebula 5.2 'Excession' <intro_release_notes/release_notes/index.html>` relevant to vOneCloud:

* **Support for clustered Datastores**, SDRS clustered :ref:`datastores <vcenter_ds>` are now visible in vCenter
* **Better Sunstone support**, with host dropdown option in DS creation and image import.
* **Network monitoring**, now vCenter VMs network traffic is accounted for in OpenNebula.

The :ref:`Automated Upgrade process <control_panel_automatic_upgrades>` implemented by the :ref:`Control Panel <control_panel>` will only be available to users with an active support subscription. With this functionality users will be notified when a new vOneCloud release is available for download and they will be able to upgrade the vOneCloud platform with a single click.
