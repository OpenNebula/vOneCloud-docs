Upgrading to a newer version of vOneCloud is only supported for users with an `active support subscription <http://vonecloud.today/#support>`__.

The upgrade process is carried out in the :ref:`Control Panel web interface <control_panel>`. When a new vOneCloud release is available for download, users with an active support subscription will be notified in the main Dashboard area of the Control Panel, and will be able to upgrade with a single click.
